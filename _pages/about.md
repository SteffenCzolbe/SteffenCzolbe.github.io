I am a PhD Fellow of Machine Learning with the Department of Computer science at the <a href="https://www.ku.dk/english/">University of Copenhagen</a>, co-advised by Aasa Feragen and Oswin Krause.

My PhD research focuses on developing deep learning methods for medical imaging, with a focus on image registration. In my work I dive into unsupervised & semi-supervised learning, with an emphasis on the registration of tricky, real-world anatomies and an ambition to develop general algorithms that apply to a multitude of problem domains and modalities. I also published on uncertainty quantification and topology detection.

Previously, I obtained a M.Sc. in computer Science from the University of Copenhagen. During my Masters I worked tgether with the LEGO group on teaching reinforcement learning with LEGO Mindstorms Robots, and designed a lightweight perceptual similarity metric for image generation and distance measuring, advised by Christian Igel.
