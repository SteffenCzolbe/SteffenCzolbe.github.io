Wow, what a year! I just published my first paper, titled "A Loss Function for Generative Neural Networks Based on Watson's Perceptual Model" at NeurIPS 2020.

To graduate from Bachelor or Masters level education in the EU, students have to write a Thesis. It is usually an independent project, taking anywhere from 3-12 months to complete. Most students never look back at this 50-odd page long document after they hand it in; doing independent research is hard, and the time of the thesis usually coincides with other important life choices, like how the hell am I gonna feed myself once I'm no longer a student?

My supervisors, Oswin Krause and Christian Igel encouraged me to go a different way: Let's submit your thesis to NeurIPS, one of the biggest Machine Learning conferences in the world. NeurIPS is a big deal. Google currently ranks it as the 21st most influential publication venue in science . Not just computer science, but science in general! It ranks higher than famous journals such as "Nature Medicine", "Physical Review" and "Nano Energy". Over 80% of paper submitted to NeurIPS are rejected in the rigorous double-blind peer-review process.

After a lot of work of editing my thesis down to 8 pages, debating with reviewers and running experiments to compare against further methods, my paper finally got accepted.

As for the content of the paper, I recommend to watch the video I created for the publication:
