Variational auto-encoders (VAEs) are a form of generative neural networks. We can utilize these models to generate new images, sentences or music pieces, which the model has never seen before. My app extends on this functionality by allowing us to leverage the generative power of VAEs to perform high-level, feature-based changes to pictures. The project, including a pre-trained model, is available on <a href="https://github.com/SteffenCzolbe/FeatureTransferApp">Github</a>. I further published a video presenting the app and explaining the model.
